This is an introductory-level course in supervised learning, with a focus on regression and classification methods. The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines; neural networks and deep learning; survival models; multiple testing. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical). This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing in this course is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chatper. We also offer the separate and original version of this course called Statistical Learning with R – the chapter lectures are the same, but the lab lectures and computing are done using R. The lectures cover all the material in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (Springer, 2023. The pdf for this book is available for free on the book website. What you'll learn Overview of statistical learning Linear regression Classificaiton Resampling methods Linear model selection and regularization Moving beyond linearity Tree-based methods Support vector machines Deep learning Survival modeling Unsupervised learning Multiple testing Frequently Asked Questions Do I need to buy a textbook? The book is nice to own, and is available from Amazon and other booksellers. However a free online version of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (Springer, 2023) is available from that website. Springer has agreed to this, so no need to worry about copyright. Of course you may not distribute printed versions of that pdf file. Are Python and Jupyter Notebook available for free? Yes. You get Python for free from https://python.org/downloads/. Typically it installs with a click. You get Jupyter Notebook from https://jupyter.org/install, also for free, and a similarly easy install. How many hours of effort are expected per week? We anticipate it will take approximately 3-5 hours per week to go through the materials and exercises in each section.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning. Prerequisites A conferred bachelor’s degree with an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better No prior programming experience required.

Audio signal processing is an engineering field that focuses on the computational methods for intentionally altering sounds, methods that are used in many musical applications. We have tried to put together a course that can be of interest and accessible to people coming from diverse backgrounds while going deep into several signal processing topics. We focus on the spectral processing techniques of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds, developing the basic theoretical and practical knowledge with which to analyze, synthesize, transform and describe audio signals in the context of music applications. The course is based on open software and content. The demonstrations and programming exercises are done using Python under Ubuntu, and the references and materials for the course come from open online repositories. We are also distributing with open licenses the software and materials developed for the course. Course Syllabus Week 1: Introduction; basic mathematics Week 2: Discrete Fourier transform Week 3: Fourier transform properties Week 4: Short-time Fourier transform Week 5: Sinusoidal model Week 6: Harmonic model Week 7: Sinusoidal plus residual modeling Week 8: Sound transformations Week 9: Sound/music description Week 10: Concluding topics; beyond audio signal processing Instructors Xavier Serra, Professor, Dept. of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona Prof Julius O Smith, III, Professor of Music and (by courtesy) Electrical Engineering, CCRMA, Stanford University Recommended Background The course assumes some basic background in mathematics and signal processing. Also, since the assignments are done with the programming language Python, some software programming background in any language is most helpful. Suggested Readings The main software tools used are in https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools and the sounds to be studied come from https://freesound.org. Most of the external references come from Julius O Smith website, https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos, or from https://www.wikipedia.org. FAQ How much programming background is needed for the course? All the assignments start from some existing Python code that the student will have to understand and modify. Some programming experience is necessary. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will play around with sounds a lot, analysing them, transforming them, and making interesting new sounds.

Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical). This is not a math-heavy class, so we try and describe the methods without heavy reliance on formulas and complex mathematics. We focus on what we consider to be the important elements of modern data science. Computing in this course is done in Python. There are lectures devoted to Python, giving tutorials from the ground up, and progressing with more detailed sessions that implement the techniques in each chatper. We also offer the separate and original version of this course called Statistical Learning with R – the chapter lectures are the same, but the lab lectures and computing are done using R. The lectures cover all the material in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (Springer, 2023. The pdf for this book is available for free on the book website. What you'll learn Overview of statistical learning Linear regression Classificaiton Resampling methods Linear model selection and regularization Moving beyond linearity Tree-based methods Support vector machines Deep learning Survival modeling Unsupervised learning Multiple testing Frequently Asked Questions Do I need to buy a textbook? The book is nice to own, and is available from Amazon and other booksellers. However a free online version of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (Springer, 2023) is available from that website. Springer has agreed to this, so no need to worry about copyright. Of course you may not distribute printed versions of that pdf file. Are Python and Jupyter Notebook available for free? Yes. You get Python for free from https://python.org/downloads/. Typically it installs with a click. You get Jupyter Notebook from https://jupyter.org/install, also for free, and a similarly easy install. How many hours of effort are expected per week? We anticipate it will take approximately 3-5 hours per week to go through the materials and exercises in each section.

To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

We focus on the spectral processing techniques of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds, developing the basic theoretical and practical knowledge with which to analyze, synthesize, transform and describe audio signals in the context of music applications. The course is based on open software and content. The demonstrations and programming exercises are done using Python under Ubuntu, and the references and materials for the course come from open online repositories. We are also distributing with open licenses the software and materials developed for the course. Course Syllabus Week 1: Introduction; basic mathematics Week 2: Discrete Fourier transform Week 3: Fourier transform properties Week 4: Short-time Fourier transform Week 5: Sinusoidal model Week 6: Harmonic model Week 7: Sinusoidal plus residual modeling Week 8: Sound transformations Week 9: Sound/music description Week 10: Concluding topics; beyond audio signal processing Instructors Xavier Serra, Professor, Dept. of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona Prof Julius O Smith, III, Professor of Music and (by courtesy) Electrical Engineering, CCRMA, Stanford University Recommended Background The course assumes some basic background in mathematics and signal processing. Also, since the assignments are done with the programming language Python, some software programming background in any language is most helpful. Suggested Readings The main software tools used are in https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools and the sounds to be studied come from https://freesound.org. Most of the external references come from Julius O Smith website, https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos, or from https://www.wikipedia.org. FAQ How much programming background is needed for the course? All the assignments start from some existing Python code that the student will have to understand and modify. Some programming experience is necessary. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will play around with sounds a lot, analysing them, transforming them, and making interesting new sounds.

However a free online version of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in Python by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (Springer, 2023) is available from that website. Springer has agreed to this, so no need to worry about copyright. Of course you may not distribute printed versions of that pdf file. Are Python and Jupyter Notebook available for free? Yes. You get Python for free from https://python.org/downloads/. Typically it installs with a click. You get Jupyter Notebook from https://jupyter.org/install, also for free, and a similarly easy install. How many hours of effort are expected per week? We anticipate it will take approximately 3-5 hours per week to go through the materials and exercises in each section.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Audio signal processing is an engineering field that focuses on the computational methods for intentionally altering sounds, methods that are used in many musical applications. We have tried to put together a course that can be of interest and accessible to people coming from diverse backgrounds while going deep into several signal processing topics. We focus on the spectral processing techniques of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds, developing the basic theoretical and practical knowledge with which to analyze, synthesize, transform and describe audio signals in the context of music applications. The course is based on open software and content. The demonstrations and programming exercises are done using Python under Ubuntu, and the references and materials for the course come from open online repositories. We are also distributing with open licenses the software and materials developed for the course. Course Syllabus Week 1: Introduction; basic mathematics Week 2: Discrete Fourier transform Week 3: Fourier transform properties Week 4: Short-time Fourier transform Week 5: Sinusoidal model Week 6: Harmonic model Week 7: Sinusoidal plus residual modeling Week 8: Sound transformations Week 9: Sound/music description Week 10: Concluding topics; beyond audio signal processing Instructors Xavier Serra, Professor, Dept. of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona Prof Julius O Smith, III, Professor of Music and (by courtesy) Electrical Engineering, CCRMA, Stanford University Recommended Background The course assumes some basic background in mathematics and signal processing. Also, since the assignments are done with the programming language Python, some software programming background in any language is most helpful. Suggested Readings The main software tools used are in https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools and the sounds to be studied come from https://freesound.org. Most of the external references come from Julius O Smith website, https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos, or from https://www.wikipedia.org. FAQ How much programming background is needed for the course? All the assignments start from some existing Python code that the student will have to understand and modify. Some programming experience is necessary. What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class? You will play around with sounds a lot, analysing them, transforming them, and making interesting new sounds.

Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning—an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning. Prerequisites A conferred bachelor’s degree with an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better Proficiency in Python All class assignments will be in Python. If you have a lot of programming experience but in a different language (e.g. C/ C++/ Matlab/ Javascript) you will probably be fine. College Calculus, Linear Algebra (e.g. MATH 51, CME 100) You should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix vector operations and notation. Basic Probability and Statistics (e.g. CS 109 or other stats course) You should know basics of probabilities, Gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc. Foundations of Machine Learning We will be formulating cost functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with gradient descent. Either CS 221 or CS 229 cover this background. Some optimization tricks will be more intuitive with some knowledge of convex optimization.

Specialization - 4 course series
This Core Java Specialization is part of a series of programming specializations, derived from LearnQuest's private Java Bootcamps, designed to provide the skill set necessary to be hired as an IT developer using Java in many corporate environments.
To be successful in this specialization, we recommend you have an understanding of the fundamentals of software development in any language. LearnQuest offers a beginning programmer specialization that can help you prepare.
In the four courses of this specialization, you’ll quickly master the Java programming language and the packages that constitute its rich set of core libraries. We’ll provide hands-on exercises so you can practice your new skills. 
 In Course 1, we’ll introduce you to the basic fundamentals of the Java language. 
Course 2 provides a refresher on object-oriented programming, and how you can apply OO to Java. We’ll introduce Java classes, instances and packaging.
By the time you get to course 3, you’ll be ready to go deeper into applying OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance and polymorphism.
In course 4 you’ll learn how to use selected parts of the Java SE Class LIbrary, including Generics, Collections, Java Streams, I/O, Exceptions, Annotations and Enums.
While we'll touch on other important Java topics, such as database connectivity, Java EE and Spring, those topics are covered in greater detail in other LearnQuest Java Specializations. 
Applied Learning Project
Throughout the specialization, you will complete hands-on labs to gain experience following the lessons taught in this course.  You will learn to use the Eclipse environment to create Java projects to work in.  You will use these projects to help develop skills in working with Java data types, and control of the flow of your programs, objects, methods, classes and interfaces.  Skills that you will practice in these projects will help you in implementing polymorphism, including calculator (math) functions, and an inventory project.

Specialization - 4 course series
This Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java. In addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data. These software engineering skills are broadly applicable across wide array of industries.
Applied Learning Project
In this Specialization, you will demonstrate your new proficiency in Java and object-oriented programming design through the development of four Java applications: an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption program, an interactive map for displaying geospatial data, and a program that will allow users to manage, manipulate, and reason about large sets of textual data.

Some courses may be audited for free. In a subset of these courses, you can pay to earn a verified certificate. Click “ENROLL NOW” to visit Coursera and get more information on course details and enrollment. In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design. You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. While Part 2 is designed for students who have already taken Part 1, some students have successfully completed Part 2 without taking Part 1.

Compilers (SOE-YCSCS1),"This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.",https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers,Paid after free trial,4.836070622034688,,"Compilers I Stanford Online We're sorry but you will need to enable Javascript to access all of the features of this site.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free. In a subset of these courses, you can pay to earn a verified certificate. Click “ENROLL NOW” to visit edX and get more information on course details and enrollment. This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to ""flip coins"" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Specific topics in the course include: ""Big-oh"" notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts), data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of BFS and DFS, connectivity, shortest paths). Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers? Core Competencies Algorithms Matrix Multiplication Master Theorem Divide And Conquer Data Structures Bloom Filter What You Need to Get Started This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience. This course is not an introduction to programming, and it assumes that you have basic programming skills in a language such as Python, Java, or C.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. While Part 2 is designed for students who have already taken Part 1, some students have successfully completed Part 2 without taking Part 1.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free.

Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

Specialization - 4 course series
This Core Java Specialization is part of a series of programming specializations, derived from LearnQuest's private Java Bootcamps, designed to provide the skill set necessary to be hired as an IT developer using Java in many corporate environments.
To be successful in this specialization, we recommend you have an understanding of the fundamentals of software development in any language. LearnQuest offers a beginning programmer specialization that can help you prepare.
In the four courses of this specialization, you’ll quickly master the Java programming language and the packages that constitute its rich set of core libraries. We’ll provide hands-on exercises so you can practice your new skills. 
 In Course 1, we’ll introduce you to the basic fundamentals of the Java language. 
Course 2 provides a refresher on object-oriented programming, and how you can apply OO to Java. We’ll introduce Java classes, instances and packaging.
By the time you get to course 3, you’ll be ready to go deeper into applying OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance and polymorphism.
In course 4 you’ll learn how to use selected parts of the Java SE Class LIbrary, including Generics, Collections, Java Streams, I/O, Exceptions, Annotations and Enums.
While we'll touch on other important Java topics, such as database connectivity, Java EE and Spring, those topics are covered in greater detail in other LearnQuest Java Specializations. 
Applied Learning Project
Throughout the specialization, you will complete hands-on labs to gain experience following the lessons taught in this course.  You will learn to use the Eclipse environment to create Java projects to work in.  You will use these projects to help develop skills in working with Java data types, and control of the flow of your programs, objects, methods, classes and interfaces.  Skills that you will practice in these projects will help you in implementing polymorphism, including calculator (math) functions, and an inventory project.

Specialization - 4 course series
This Core Java Specialization is part of a series of programming specializations, derived from LearnQuest's private Java Bootcamps, designed to provide the skill set necessary to be hired as an IT developer using Java in many corporate environments.
To be successful in this specialization, we recommend you have an understanding of the fundamentals of software development in any language. LearnQuest offers a beginning programmer specialization that can help you prepare.
In the four courses of this specialization, you’ll quickly master the Java programming language and the packages that constitute its rich set of core libraries. We’ll provide hands-on exercises so you can practice your new skills. 
 In Course 1, we’ll introduce you to the basic fundamentals of the Java language. 
Course 2 provides a refresher on object-oriented programming, and how you can apply OO to Java. We’ll introduce Java classes, instances and packaging.
By the time you get to course 3, you’ll be ready to go deeper into applying OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance and polymorphism.
In course 4 you’ll learn how to use selected parts of the Java SE Class LIbrary, including Generics, Collections, Java Streams, I/O, Exceptions, Annotations and Enums.
While we'll touch on other important Java topics, such as database connectivity, Java EE and Spring, those topics are covered in greater detail in other LearnQuest Java Specializations. 
Applied Learning Project
Throughout the specialization, you will complete hands-on labs to gain experience following the lessons taught in this course.  You will learn to use the Eclipse environment to create Java projects to work in.  You will use these projects to help develop skills in working with Java data types, and control of the flow of your programs, objects, methods, classes and interfaces.  Skills that you will practice in these projects will help you in implementing polymorphism, including calculator (math) functions, and an inventory project.

Specialization - 4 course series
This Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java. In addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data. These software engineering skills are broadly applicable across wide array of industries.
Applied Learning Project
In this Specialization, you will demonstrate your new proficiency in Java and object-oriented programming design through the development of four Java applications: an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption program, an interactive map for displaying geospatial data, and a program that will allow users to manage, manipulate, and reason about large sets of textual data.

The Extended Course consists of the Basic Course followed by a more intense two weeks exercise called Test Flight. Whereas the focus in the Basic Course is the development of mathematically-based thinking skills for everyday life, the focus in Test Flight is on applying those skills to mathematics itself. Suggested Readings There is one reading assignment at the start, providing some motivational background. There is a supplemental reading unit describing elementary set theory for students who are not familiar with the material. There is a course textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Thinking , by Keith Devlin, available at low cost (under $10) from Amazon, in hard copy and Kindle versions, but it is not required in order to complete the course. For general background on mathematics and its role in the modern world, take a look at the five week survey course on mathematics (""Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible"") Devlin gave at Stanford in fall 2012, available for free download from iTunes University (Stanford) , and on YouTube (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5 ), particularly the first halves of lectures 1 and 4.

The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years. Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today's world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking. The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course. Subtitles for all video lectures available in: Portuguese (provided by The Lemann Foundation), English Course Syllabus Instructor's welcome and introduction Introductory material Analysis of language – the logical combinators Analysis of language – implication Analysis of language – equivalence Analysis of language – quantifiers Working with quantifiers Proofs Proofs involving quantifiers Elements of number theory Beginning real analysis Recommended Background High school mathematics. Specific requirements are familiarity with elementary symbolic algebra, the concept of a number system (in particular, the characteristics of, and distinctions between, the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers), and some elementary set theory (including inequalities and intervals of the real line). Students whose familiarity with these topics is somewhat rusty typically find that with a little extra effort they can pick up what is required along the way. The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course. A good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies' aim in producing it).

It combines really important information on the brain and learning with new evidence on the best ways to approach and learn math effectively. Many people have had negative experiences with math, and end up disliking math or failing. This class will give learners of math the information they need to become powerful math learners, it will correct any misconceptions they have about what math is, and it will teach them about their own potential to succeed and the strategies needed to approach math effectively. If you have had past negative experiences with math this will help change your relationship to one that is positive and powerful. The course will feature Jo and a team of undergraduates, as well as videos of math in action - in dance, juggling, snowflakes, soccer and many other applications. It is designed with a pedagogy of active engagement.The course will run from May/June to the end of December, 2014. Course Concepts and Structure The course will consist of six short lessons, taking approximately 20 minutes each. The lessons will combine presentations from Dr. Boaler and a team of undergraduates, interviews with members of the public, cutting edge research ideas, interesting visuals and films, and explorations of math in nature, sport and design. Part 1: The Brain and Math Learning. Knocking Down the Myths About Math. Everyone can learn math well. There is no such thing as a math person. This session give stunning new evidence on brain growth, and consider what it means for math learners. Math and Mindset When individuals change their mindset from fixed to growth their learning potential increases drastically. In this session participants will be encouraged to develop a growth mindset for math. Mistakes and Speed Recent brain evidence shows the value of students working on challenging work and even making mistakes. But many students are afraid of mistakes and think it means they are not a math person. This session will encourage students to think positively about mistakes. It will also help debunk myths about math and speed. Part 2: Strategies for Success. Number Flexibility, Mathematical Reasoning, and Connections In this session participants will engage in a number talk and see different solutions of number problems to understand and learn ways to act on numbers flexibility. Number sense is critical to all levels of math and lack of number sense is the reason that many students fail courses in algebra and beyond. Participants will also learn about the value of talking, reasoning, and making connections in math. Number Patterns and Representations In this session participants will see that math is a subject that is made up of connected, big ideas. They will learn about the value of sense making, intuition, and mathematical drawing. A special section on fractions will help students learn the big ideas in fractions and the value of understanding big ideas in math more generally. Math in Life, Nature and Work In this session participants will see math as something valuable, exciting, and present throughout life. They will see mathematical patterns in nature and in different sports, exploring in depth the mathematics in dance and juggling. This session will review the key ideas from the course and help participants take the important strategies and ideas they have learned into their future. Instructors Dr. Jo Boaler is a Professor of Mathematics Education at Stanford University and founder of youcubed. Former roles have included being the Marie Curie Professor of Mathematics Education at the University of Sussex, England, a mathematics teacher in London comprehensive schools, and a lecturer and researcher at King’s College, London.

The Extended Course consists of the Basic Course followed by a more intense two weeks exercise called Test Flight. Whereas the focus in the Basic Course is the development of mathematically-based thinking skills for everyday life, the focus in Test Flight is on applying those skills to mathematics itself. Suggested Readings There is one reading assignment at the start, providing some motivational background. There is a supplemental reading unit describing elementary set theory for students who are not familiar with the material. There is a course textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Thinking , by Keith Devlin, available at low cost (under $10) from Amazon, in hard copy and Kindle versions, but it is not required in order to complete the course. For general background on mathematics and its role in the modern world, take a look at the five week survey course on mathematics (""Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible"") Devlin gave at Stanford in fall 2012, available for free download from iTunes University (Stanford) , and on YouTube (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5 ), particularly the first halves of lectures 1 and 4. Coursera Course Certificate Available for a Fee Stanford courses offered through Coursera are subject to Coursera’s pricing structures.

The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years. Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today's world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking. The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course. Subtitles for all video lectures available in: Portuguese (provided by The Lemann Foundation), English Course Syllabus Instructor's welcome and introduction Introductory material Analysis of language – the logical combinators Analysis of language – implication Analysis of language – equivalence Analysis of language – quantifiers Working with quantifiers Proofs Proofs involving quantifiers Elements of number theory Beginning real analysis Recommended Background High school mathematics. Specific requirements are familiarity with elementary symbolic algebra, the concept of a number system (in particular, the characteristics of, and distinctions between, the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers), and some elementary set theory (including inequalities and intervals of the real line). Students whose familiarity with these topics is somewhat rusty typically find that with a little extra effort they can pick up what is required along the way. The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course. A good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies' aim in producing it).

The lessons will combine presentations from Dr. Boaler and a team of undergraduates, interviews with members of the public, cutting edge research ideas, interesting visuals and films, and explorations of math in nature, sport and design. Part 1: The Brain and Math Learning. Knocking Down the Myths About Math. Everyone can learn math well. There is no such thing as a math person. This session give stunning new evidence on brain growth, and consider what it means for math learners. Math and Mindset When individuals change their mindset from fixed to growth their learning potential increases drastically. In this session participants will be encouraged to develop a growth mindset for math. Mistakes and Speed Recent brain evidence shows the value of students working on challenging work and even making mistakes. But many students are afraid of mistakes and think it means they are not a math person. This session will encourage students to think positively about mistakes. It will also help debunk myths about math and speed. Part 2: Strategies for Success. Number Flexibility, Mathematical Reasoning, and Connections In this session participants will engage in a number talk and see different solutions of number problems to understand and learn ways to act on numbers flexibility. Number sense is critical to all levels of math and lack of number sense is the reason that many students fail courses in algebra and beyond. Participants will also learn about the value of talking, reasoning, and making connections in math. Number Patterns and Representations In this session participants will see that math is a subject that is made up of connected, big ideas. They will learn about the value of sense making, intuition, and mathematical drawing. A special section on fractions will help students learn the big ideas in fractions and the value of understanding big ideas in math more generally. Math in Life, Nature and Work In this session participants will see math as something valuable, exciting, and present throughout life. They will see mathematical patterns in nature and in different sports, exploring in depth the mathematics in dance and juggling. This session will review the key ideas from the course and help participants take the important strategies and ideas they have learned into their future.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. While Part 2 is designed for students who have already taken Part 1, some students have successfully completed Part 2 without taking Part 1.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free.

Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. While Part 2 is designed for students who have already taken Part 1, some students have successfully completed Part 2 without taking Part 1.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free.

Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course. Much of the course material is covered by the well-known textbooks on algorithms, and the student is encouraged to consult their favorite for additional information. Course Format The class will consist of lecture videos, generally between 10 and 15 minutes in length. These usually have integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone homeworks and programming assignments that are not part of video lectures, and a final exam. FAQ Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class? Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. What is the format of the class? The class consists of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes that are not part of video lectures. There will be approximately two hours worth of video content per week. What should I know to take this class? How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction; and some discrete probability, like how to compute the probability that a poker hand is a full house. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free.

Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. You'll learn what NP-completeness and the famous ""P vs. NP"" problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, we'll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950's (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by ""just"" solving a math problem! Course Syllabus Weeks 1 and 2: The greedy algorithm design paradigm. Applications to optimal caching and scheduling. Minimum spanning trees and applications to clustering. The union-find data structure. Optimal data compression. Weeks 3 and 4: The dynamic programming design paradigm. Applications to the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, shortest-path routing, and optimal search trees. Weeks 5 and 6: Intractable problems and what to do about them. NP-completeness and the P vs. NP question. Solvable special cases. Heuristics with provable performance guarantees. Local search. Exponential-time algorithms that beat brute-force search. Recommended Background How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction. At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors. The course assumes familiarity with some of the topics from Algo 1 --- especially asymptotic analysis, basic data structures, and basic graph algorithms. Suggested Readings No specific textbook is required for the course.

Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor. Textbooks & Resources No, no textbook is required for the class. However, you may find a textbook useful as a reference or to learn more details of some of the ideas discussed in the course. There are a number of good textbooks on compilers; here are three in particular: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Second Edition) Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman. Addison-Wesley Modern Compiler Implementation in Java (Second Edition) Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. Cambridge University Press Engineering a Compiler Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon. Morgan Kaufman Time Commitment The estimated effort per week will vary per student, but basically, you should expect to spend: 3 hours per week in this course if you are not planning to do the programming assignments. 6-10 hours per week for experienced programmers. Your mileage will vary, depending on how well you already know the programming language, how long it takes to learn to use the tools and libraries, and how experienced you are at debugging. Questions? There will be an online discussion forum in which students can ask questions and receive answers. As this course is self-paced, the forum will be largely unmoderated. Answers will come from fellow participants, as a result. Stanford courses offered through edX are subject to edX’s pricing structures. Some courses may be audited for free.

Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly. Instructor Alex Aiken, Alcatel-Lucent Professor in Communications and Networking and Professor of Particle Physics and Astrophysics and of Photon Science Teaching Team Alex Aiken Alcatel-Lucent Professor Computer Science Alex Aiken Alex Aiken is the Alcatel-Lucent Professor and the current Tencent Chair of the Computer Science Department at Stanford. His research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors.

Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.
In this Specialization, you will learn how to build dynamic web applications with server-side functionality.

Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.
In this Specialization, you will learn how to build dynamic web applications with server-side functionality.

Professional Certificate - 9 course series
Want to get started in the world of coding and build websites as a career? This certificate, designed by the software engineering experts at Meta—the creators of Facebook and Instagram, will prepare you for a career as a front-end developer.
In this program, you’ll learn: 
How to code and build interactive web pages using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 
In-demand design skills to create professional page layouts using industry-standard tools such as Bootstrap, React, and Figma. 
GitHub repositories for version control, content management system (CMS) and how to edit images using Figma. 
How to prepare for technical interviews for front-end developer roles.
By the end, you’ll put your new skills to work by completing a real-world project where you’ll create your own front-end web application. Any third-party trademarks and other intellectual property (including logos and icons) referenced in the learning experience remain the property of their respective owners. Unless specifically identified as such, Coursera’s use of third-party intellectual property does not indicate any relationship, sponsorship, or endorsement between Coursera and the owners of these trademarks or other intellectual property.
Applied Learning Project
Throughout the program, you’ll engage in hands-on activities that offer opportunities to practice and implement what you are learning. You’ll complete hands-on projects that you can showcase during job interviews and on relevant social networks.
At the end of each course, you’ll complete a project to test your new skills and ensure you understand the criteria before moving on to the next course. There are 9 projects in which you’ll use a lab environment or a web application to perform tasks such as:  
Edit your Bio page—using your skills in HTML5, CSS and UI frameworks
Manage a project in GitHub—using version control in Git, Git repositories and the Linux Terminal 
Build a static version of an application—you’ll apply your understanding of React, frameworks, routing, hooks, bundlers and data fetching. 
At the end of the program, there will be a Capstone project where you will bring your new skillset together to create the front-end web application.

The experience from taking certificates from Coursera was good.

If you want to learn a single language used for both front-end and back-end development, this JavaScript specialization from IBM is for you. 
You can use this versatile, popular programming language to architect cloud-based, interactive applications. Industry leaders choose JavaScript’s popular React library for crafting dynamic user experiences and creating modular, server-side applications using the Node.js Express framework. This specialization contains courses on each of these robust JavaScript technologies and more!
In the final course, you will learn to connect your JavaScript applications to the open-source NoSQL database, MongoDB. You’ll want to learn about NoSQL databases because contemporary applications require their flexibility for querying large amounts of unstructured data. Finally, you will write REST APIs to get all of these services to communicate with each other.
Throughout this program, you will develop several applications with these various technologies. Upon completing the full program, you will have a portfolio of JavaScript projects to provide you with the confidence to excel in your interviews.
We highly recommend you have a familiarity with HTML and CSS concepts and their syntax. A working knowledge of a version control system such as Git or GitHub is recommended but not essential.
Applied Learning Project
Each course affords multiple practice opportunities through labs that mimic real-world applications. The final module of each course provides a hands-on final project to integrate the skills learned throughout the course. Projects include: 
Crafting a travel recommendation website using JavaScript APIs that align with your users’ preferences
Designing and coding the front end of a budget allocation application using React
Writing a server-side application that stores, retrieves, and manages book ratings and reviews with Node.js and Express framework
Design an e-commerce website by implementing user authentication with JWT, create RESTful APIs, and save data using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.

Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.
In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

Specialization - 4 course series
If you want to learn a single language used for both front-end and back-end development, this JavaScript specialization from IBM is for you. 
You can use this versatile, popular programming language to architect cloud-based, interactive applications. Industry leaders choose JavaScript’s popular React library for crafting dynamic user experiences and creating modular, server-side applications using the Node.js Express framework. This specialization contains courses on each of these robust JavaScript technologies and more!
In the final course, you will learn to connect your JavaScript applications to the open-source NoSQL database, MongoDB. You’ll want to learn about NoSQL databases because contemporary applications require their flexibility for querying large amounts of unstructured data. Finally, you will write REST APIs to get all of these services to communicate with each other.
Throughout this program, you will develop several applications with these various technologies. Upon completing the full program, you will have a portfolio of JavaScript projects to provide you with the confidence to excel in your interviews.
We highly recommend you have a familiarity with HTML and CSS concepts and their syntax. A working knowledge of a version control system such as Git or GitHub is recommended but not essential.
Applied Learning Project
Each course affords multiple practice opportunities through labs that mimic real-world applications. The final module of each course provides a hands-on final project to integrate the skills learned throughout the course. Projects include: 
Crafting a travel recommendation website using JavaScript APIs that align with your users’ preferences
Designing and coding the front end of a budget allocation application using React
Writing a server-side application that stores, retrieves, and manages book ratings and reviews with Node.js and Express framework
Design an e-commerce website by implementing user authentication with JWT, create RESTful APIs, and save data using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.

Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.
In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of respective languages. CS106A introduces computer programming for people who have not programmed before. To learn programming, you need to do a lot of guided programming, and have a lot of help at hand-that's CS106A. Recently, CS106A has switched to using the Python programming language and lab-style coding in lecture. But at its heart, it is still CS106A - introduce the world of computers to a broad audience. This course will cover all the important topics of basic programming in Python: types, numbers, strings, functions, linear collections, dictionaries, logic, decomposition, good programming style, whole-program structure, text, file-processing, debugging, and performance. This course will also touch on more advanced topics you might want in the future, including lambdas, comprehensions, modules, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a huge language with many advanced features, and CS106A does not do the whole thing. CS106A teaches the important core features, and you will be able to solve real programming problems with just this course. Python 3/ PyCharm This course will use Python version 3. At first you will just use parlante.org so you don't need to install anything. Later we will do larger exercises where you will need a computer with Python 3 installed on it. You will also need to install the free PyCharm development environment. Detailed instructions will be provided. It is best to have your laptop during the lecture. This course will experiment integrating little exercises within lecture. Education research shows that doing a little activity with what you just saw helps a lot with learning.

Contact Us What Our Learners Are Saying Strategies for Sustainability brought together key themes of systems thinking, leadership and the circular economy in an extremely clear and thought-provoking course. I am living and breathing these topics in my career at MCi Carbon (building circular carbon technology) and I have been able to incorporate many practical and strategic lessons while scaling the technology to stop climate change. MCi Carbon Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Teaching Team Pamela Matson Richard & Rhoda Goldman Professor (Emerita) Earth System Science Pamela Matson Pamela Matson is a Professor of Environmental Studies at Stanford University. She is an internationally recognized interdisciplinary Earth scientist, academic leader and organizational strategist. A MacArthur Fellow and elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, Matson has served as dean of the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences at Stanford since 2002. She has led the School through significant change, targeted at helping improve the University’s ability to engage in use- inspired research and to educate future leaders in the sustainability challenges related to Earth resources, hazards and environment. During the same time period, Matson co-led the Stanford Challenge Initiative on Environment and Sustainability, and helped build the Woods Institute for the Environment and the Precourt Institute for Energy as well as the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources. Scientifically, Matson is a global thought leader who works to reconcile the needs of people and the planet in the 21st century. Her research addresses a range of environment and sustainability issues, including sustainability of agricultural systems; vulnerability of particular people and places to climate change; and environmental consequences of tropical land use change and global change in the nitrogen and carbon cycles. With multidisciplinary teams of researchers, managers, and decision makers, she has worked to develop agricultural approaches that reduce environmental impacts while maintaining livelihoods and human wellbeing. Matson is the founding co-chair of the National Academies’ Roundtable on Science and Technology for Sustainability, and serves on the boards of FFAR (Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, World Wildlife Fund and Climate Works Foundation. She is a past president of the Ecological Society of America, past lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and was a member of the science leadership committee for the International Geosphere-Atmosphere Programme.
